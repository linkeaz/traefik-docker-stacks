## 💡 Project Overview

This project provides a collection of **secure Docker Compose stacks**, designed for reliable deployment on **public infrastructures, remote servers, and security-sensitive environments**. Each configuration is optimized to **minimize port exposure**, **encrypt communications**, and **restrict access to sensitive interfaces**.

It simplifies self-hosting by ensuring **secure routing** and **automated SSL certificate management** via Let's Encrypt.

### 🔹 Features and Security:

- **Traefik** as a reverse proxy to centralize and secure service access.
- **Automated SSL certificate management** with Let's Encrypt.
- **Dockge** for graphical management of Docker stacks.
- **IP filtering and authentication** to restrict access to sensitive interfaces.
- **Minimal port exposure** to reduce the attack surface.
- **Encrypted communications** and adherence to security best practices.
- **Modular organization** allowing easy integration of new services.

## 🔧 Available Stacks

### 🏗 **Traefik** (Secure Reverse Proxy)

- Intelligent routing for HTTP/HTTPS requests.
- Automated SSL certificate management.
- Service security with middlewares (authentication, IP filtering, etc.).

### 📊 **Dockge** (Container Management Interface)

- Simplified web interface for managing services.
- Quick access to logs and Docker configurations.
- Easy integration with Traefik.

### 🔄 **Other Modular Services**

This project is designed to be **scalable**, allowing additional services to be integrated into Traefik with custom configurations.

---

## ⚙️ Configuration and Customization

Each stack offers different configuration methods depending on usage:

- **Via `.env` files**: Some services use environment variables stored in a `.env` file.
- **Via `docker-compose.yml`**: Main configurations are directly within this file.
- **Customization during installation**: Some parameters must be manually set before deployment.

### Configuration Examples

- **Secure Access**: Add authentication or restrict access via Traefik middlewares.
- **SSL Certificates**: Let's Encrypt automatically generates certificates; ensure your DNS is correctly set up before deployment.
